#### Context

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds.
However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, 
along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown.

#### Data 

a.	Data Sourcing
i.	This is external data containing expert ratings of over 1,700 chocolate bars

d.	Data Relevance
i.	This could be relevant for several reasons. The data provided could be used to analyze which chocolate bean produces the best tasting bar, the percentage of cocoa contained in each bar, and which company/country of origin is producing the best chocolate. 

e.	Data Limitations
i.	The dataset stops collection in 2017 
ii.	This data should be unbiased

Data Cleaning and Wrangling

1)	Sorted data by review date
2)	Changed column names to names that are more intuitive
3)	Checked for null values
4)	Replaced null values in ‘bean_type’ and ‘broad_bean_origin’ with “unknown.”
5)	Checked for duplicate values (none found)
6)	Checked for mixed types (none found)
7)	Exported clean data to .csv

#### Key Questions

1)	Which countries are producing the best tasting chocolate?
2)	Is there a correlation between cocoa percentage and taste rating?
3)	Do certain countries produce beans that result in a higher taste rating?
